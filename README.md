# CIS-1051-Final-Project

#### I plan to make a game similar to "Doodle Jump". The player will operate a character that never stops jumping and the goal is to go as high as possible by jumping on platforms. There will be various obstacles that attempt to end the game or hinder the players' progress. There is lava that slowly rises up beneath the player as to prevent slow and methodical gameplay and to provide the feeling of rush. I intend to make it a side-scroller game or a game where if the character goes off the left side of the screen, the character appears on the right side of the screen, preserving momentum. (Format of text looks better in source or raw forms.)

##### Obstacles/Challenges:
~Spikes on platforms  
~Moving platforms  
~Cannons that shoot projectiles  
~Lava that slowly rises up from beneath the player  
~The playable character is in a perpetual loop of jumping. Makes the game have a cadence.  

##### Positive Power-ups:
~Clock - slows time to aid in platform jumping and avoiding projectiles  
~Jetpack - flies the character up a few stories  
~Shield - grants the player more health for a short time  

##### Negative Power-ups:
~Anvil - the player sinks down a few stories (opposite of jetpack)  
~Half Heart - player's health is diminished for a shirt time so that if the player takes any amount of damage from any source the game ends  
~Character size increase - increases the size of the character model (makes avoiding projectiles more difficult, also might add a speed scalar and momentum scalar that makes the character more sensitive to keyboard inputs)  
~Platform size decrease - decreases the size of the platforms (makes jumping on platforms more difficult)  

##### Random Outcome Power-ups:
~Portal - teleports the player either up or down a few stories  
~Random Power-up - grants a power-up from random (can be either positive or negative, akin to the Question Block from Mario)
