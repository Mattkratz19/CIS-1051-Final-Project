# CIS-1051-Final-Project

I plan to make a game similar to "Doodle Jump". The player will operate a character that never stops jumping and the goal is to go as high as possible by jumping on platforms. There will be platforms that move, ones that have spikes, and others that have either positive or negative power-ups. There is lava that slowly rises up beneath the player as to prevent slow and methodical gameplay. I intend to make it a side-scroller game or a game where if the character goes off the left side of the screen, the character appears on the right side of the screen, preserving momentum. (Format looks better in raw form.)

Obstacles/Challenges:
~Spikes on platforms
~Moving platforms
~Cannons that shoot projectiles
~Lava that slowly rises up from beneath the player
~The playable character is in a perpetual loop of jumping. Makes the game cadence-based.

Positive Power-ups:
~Clock - slows time to aid in platform jumping and avoiding projectiles
~Jetpack - flies the character up a few stories
~Shield - grants the player more health for a short time

Negative Power-ups:
~Anvil - the player sinks down a few stories (opposite of jetpack)
~Half Heart - player's health is diminished for a shirt time so that if the player takes any amount of damage from any source the game ends
~Character size increase - 

Random Outcome Power-ups:
~Portal - teleports the player either up or down a few stories
~Random Power-up - grants a power-up from random (either positive or negative)
