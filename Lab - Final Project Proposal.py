# Proposal - Matt Kratz

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
'''
Skribbl Jump
'''
## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets
# you buy and sell stocks.")
'''
My project is a game where the objective is to jump as high as the player can whilst
avoiding various obstacles and using power-ups to their advantage.
'''
## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What
# features will it have? How will it be executed?
'''
My game will take keyboard inputs and convert it into character movement. The game will
offer challenges in an attempt to inhibit the player from succeeding.
'''
## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with
# which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to
# 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list
# their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect.
# And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project.
# I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
'''
I hope to code a fully functioning game where the player controls a sprite to
progress (jump) as high as they can. I can maybe implement a few power-ups and
horizontally moving platforms. I intend to make the game 60 fps and some optimization
may be needed to achieve a steady framerate.
'''
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project.
# I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
'''
A better outcome for the game would be to add projectiles the player has to dodge,
implement a few more positive power-ups.
'''
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project.
# I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
'''
In addition to the better outcomes mentioned, the best outcome would involve a slew of
positive, negative, and neutral (random) power-ups. More obstacles would also be present.
'''
## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to
# acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates,
# who will do what?
'''
I plan to watch YouTube videos and read documentation explaining how to use pygame. I will
need to learn the ins and outs of the pygame module.
